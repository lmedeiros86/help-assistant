# Help Assistant

# ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Customer Support Assistant (MVP)

This project is a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** of an AI-powered diagnostic tool, built to directly align with the mission of the New Relic Help Experience team.

The core goal is to provide **context-aware, reliable answers** to customer technical troubleshooting questions by using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

## âœ¨ Technology Stack Showcase

This project demonstrates fluency across the required stack:

| Component | Technology | Job Requirement Alignment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend (UI)** | **React** / **TypeScript** | *Fluency in TypeScript and React* |
| **Backend (API Gateway)** | **Go** (`net/http`) | *Experience in backend services/API development* in Go. |
| **AI/RAG Service** | **Python** (LangChain, OpenAI) | *Experience with LLMs, RAG, and machine learning* (Bonus Point). |
| **Data Persistence** | **SQLite** (Go Driver) | *Database Fluency (SQL, data hygiene)*. |

***

## ðŸ’¡ Architectural Decisions and Role Alignment

The design choices reflect a customer-focused mindset and efficient engineering:

* **Polyglot Architecture:** Using **Go** for the API gateway and **Python** for the RAG service demonstrates the ability to choose the best language for the task and manage cross-service communication.
* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** RAG is implemented to retrieve relevant documents from the knowledge base, ensuring the diagnostic advice is based on facts.
* **Database Fluency:** **SQLite** was chosen for rapid prototyping, but the use of structured SQL demonstrates strong knowledge of **data hygiene** and scalability paths (to AWS RDS/PostgreSQL).
